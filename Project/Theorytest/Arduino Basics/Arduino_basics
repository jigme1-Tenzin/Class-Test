Microcontroler is the primary circuit which allows us to program the Arduino in order for it to be able to execute commands. Digital Input/output pins, USB Interface and Connector, Analog Pins, Reset Button, LED's, and Voltage Regulator. 
loop allows us to run the code repeatedly where as the setup function allows us to set up the input and output pin.
An analog signal can take on any number of values. A digital signal on the other hand, has only two values: HIGH and LOW.
